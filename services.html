        <p class="word-break" style=" text-align: center">Companies come in all shapes and sizes and so do the contracts they bid for. While we apply our successful bid writing process to all of them, we do not apply a one size fits all approach. All your responses will be written from the bottom up. We use persuasive, compelling narrative which showcases your company and highlights its key differentiators, not copy and paste or generic boilerplate text.
            Your firm may be a multi-national working across several continents, or an owner-managed business applying for a local contract. Regardless of size, sector or previous tender writing experience we can help.

            <h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
            <p>
                The approach we use is structured and systematic and it works. Over 75% of our work comes via repeat business, testament to our focus on winning and on client service. By leveraging our knowledge across sectors we are able to advise on best practice, industry standards, and most important of all ‘what good looks like.’ For larger companies we can help to identify win themes, bid writing strategy and core competence; smaller companies may just require assistance translating their existing practices into a narrative which the evaluator will score highly.

The Advantages Of Our Approach Are Clear:
                  
                  <ul style="width: 200;word-wrap: break-word;">
                      <li>You can continue to focus on your core business while complete the bid document for you.</li>
                      <li>Your money will not be wasted, as we don’t take on projects which we don’t believe we can win.</li>
                      <li>We will provide you with an honest appraisal on whether we think you have a realistic chance of winning.</li>
                      <li>The quality of work you receive will be guaranteed, as we do not use freelance writers.</li>
                      <li>Your submission is quality checked by more than one experienced tender writer and also by a senior writer.</li>
                      <li>The size of your firm does not matter! We work with family firms for that ‘must win’ bid and we provide bid our services to blue chip companies.</li>
                      <li>Your submission can be taken from a 7/10 to a 9.5/10 with the knowledge, experience and expertise of our tender writing professionals.</li>
                  </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>How We Can Help?</h3>
            <p>Generally, we prefer to complete the bid on your behalf. However, if you only require 
                assistance with certain elements or specific topics, that is fine. You can have as much 
                or as little written narrative provided by our experienced writers as you like, and we 
                will provide an individual quotation based on the level of support needed.
                At the beginning of the bid writing process, we generate <em>compliance matrices </em>
                and annotated proposal outlines. We use these to manage proposal development, or we
                share the tools so others can jumpstart the work ahead. We develop proposal strategies 
                and find compelling ways to differentiate and package solutions. Our proposal managers 
                lead the way through proposal development. On smaller proposals, they work as a team of one.
                On larger responses they work with capture managers, proposal coordinators, volume managers,
                subject matter experts, authors, editors, reviewers, cost strategists, graphic designers, and
                production specialists. Post-production, where there’s an oral presentation requirem
                ent, we design the slide deck and coach speakers on delivering the winning message.</p>

                <p>
                    A compliance matrix or compliance traceability matrix is a valuable cross-referencing
                     tool used in proposal development. It assists proposal managers by helping them ensure
                      the proposal is written in compliance with the request for proposal (RFP.) It’s an important 
                    document because developing a compliant proposal is the critical first step towards winning the bid.
                </p>

        <div class="container text editable" style="text-align: center;padding-left: 80px; padding-right: 80px; padding-top: 0; margin-top: -100px">
            <p class="word-break">To create a compliance matrix, we begin with a thorough reading of the RFP. Starting from the beginning and, in a sequential fashion, each time a proposal requirement is identified, list it on the matrix. The compliance matrix captures the requirement, the location of the requirement in the RFP, and a provision of the location in the proposal where the corresponding response appears (to be completed by bid writer).
                    At the start of writing, the compliance matrix informs the layout of the proposal outline. After the proposal is complete, it becomes a proofing tool. The matrix is used to double check that every RFP requirement found its way into the proposal.
                    The compliance matrix template provides a bit of additional functionality as well. It doubles as a status tracking tool because it captures the name of the person to whom the writing was assigned and the status of the writing.

                <h3>What Are the Inputs?</h3>
                <p>
                        The Request for Proposal (RFP) is the input to creating the compliance matrix.
                     
                </p>
                <h3>How Is It Used?</h3>
                <p class="word-break">The compliance matrix is used to prove that the proposal complies 
                    with the requirements found in the RFP. Every requirement found in the RFP is
                     listed on the compliance matrix. Alongside each 
                    requirement, the location of the proposed response is noted.</p>
                <h3>Who Creates the Compliance Matrix?</h3>
                <p>The compliance traceability matrix is created by the proposal manager. It could be created or reviewed by any number of people on the proposal team but ultimately, the document is owned by the proposal manager. It’s his or her duty to ensure the proposal is compliant with the RFP instructions.
                        At TenderMasters we understand that the resources at our clients’ organisations are busy professionals, and even if our clients opt to write tenders on their own, there may be need to have all the requirement of a proposal put in a one page, snapshot to assist in the meeting of the requirements.

                    <h3>Why Should Your Bid Be Reviewed Externally by a Professional?</h3>
                    <p>Our review service is a cost-effective approach to take your PQQ or tender
                         submission to the next level, whilst you still retain full control and management 
                         of the bid in-house. If it is a ‘must win’ bid for your company, or your first-time
                          bidding, getting a professional’s 
                        opinion and suggestions can mean the difference between a pass and fail.
                    <br>
                    It is very hard to critique your own work, especially in bid writing, as it is difficult to 
                    look at your own organisation from an external point of view to identify any points of weakness.
                     Our bid writers’ knowledge and experience of the procurement process means we are able to identify
                      areas you may have overlooked, and we know better than anyone exactly what the contracting authority 
                      is looking for. Usually companies have the correct information, but have simply not demonstrated it 
                      correctly — that is where we come in. We can advise you how to
                     improve your PQQ or tender response and gain more marks, giving you a better chance of succe
                     <br>
                    </p>
                    <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
                    <p class="word-break">Firstly, we will confirm a cost for the review, based on the expected word count of 
                        your completed submission — it takes a lot longer to review 15,000 words than it does
                         2,000 words! We will then agree a timescale for receiving your completed responses. 
                         Ideally this will be section-by-section, as soon as the responses are complete, s
                          that any comments and suggestions can be taken on board when writing the remainder
                           of your submission. We will ensure that all reviewed responses are returned to you with enough time to 
                        make any changes and discuss any issues with our writers ahead of the deadline.
                    <br>
                    Whether you are a small business completing your first PQQ or tender, or a larger company 
                    bidding for many contracts, our PQQ and tender
                     review service can help you to improve your submissions and increase your success rate.
